Portfolio Brainstorming:

On my Portfolio I will have display my games that I have created so far as well as some of my 3d art and animations.

The three games that I will display are:

Ball is Life: A roll-a-ball game with a unique point system designed to incentivize the player
Arachnocide: A high action top down shooter with horror and bullet hell elements.
Cube of Darkness: A 2.5D platformer with an emphasis on precise physics based movement.

For art I will be also display some of my blender animations and art that are on my YouTube channel.
