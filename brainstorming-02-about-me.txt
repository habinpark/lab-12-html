About Me Brainstorming:

On this page I will have a picture of me as well as some info about me that helps potential employers get to know my skilsets more.

The bio will read as follows:

Since early childhood I have a great capacity for anything technology, craft, or art related such as computer programing, videoing, film editing, and building. Moreover, I enjoy science and math related projects. Because of these skilsets I grew to love story telling through any means, such as writing, music, visuals, video, and more. Empowered by love of story telling I came to realize that video games are the ultimate form of story telling. Not only do they convey sounds and music, visuals, and text but they also make so that you are the character making decisions as to what to do. You are your own story. 

I graduated highschool in 2020 and am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Game Design and Entrepreneurship since one day I hope to start my own game studio where our mission would be to give the player an amazing story experience.
